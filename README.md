How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  Good way I have learned during this class is to use unit tests. These unit tests help me ensure that my code reacts the way it should to any type of input whether it be correct or not. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  User needs are gathered during the beginning of the projects lifecycle. They can also change throughout the project as well. It is important to always take good notes and keep in cotact with your project manager to ensure you have the correct requirments. Requirments used to check if the program is fucitoning correctly or still needs more work. 

How do I approach designing software?
  Designing software takes time. When I first get requirments I like to make a list and creat a flow chart thta shows me how everything needs to be connected. This helps me for when its time to write the code I have an idea on what needs access to what informaiton.
